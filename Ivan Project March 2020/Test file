		 <div class="section-inner">
		 <h2> Sports </h2>
		 <p> The list of sports that I have played are endless, from winning an all Ireland rowing medal to playing american football and being asked to  tryout for the irish team, my time in sport has been a colourful one to say the least.<br>
		 There is never a dull moment when playing a sport you love, from the comradery to the harshness of training, I loved it all.<br> the training for all sports provided me with an appreciation for each skillset learned and thought me discipline and mental resiliance.<br>
		 The thrill of going up against an opponent, to fight for every yard on the pitch and to leave a match knowing you gave it your all, that is what it is all about.
		 
		 <h2> Travel </h2>
		 <p> Travel is something that has peaked my interest from a very young age, with plans to travel the world with my girlfriend lined up over the coming years.<br>From the shores of France, to vineyards in Spain, the list of places I have been fortunate enough to explore is nothing short of spectacular.<br>
		 Take the Loire valley for example,The pomp and prestige of royalty and artistry poke through the patches of forest, dominate small towns and stand preserved within manicured gardens.<br> Majestic châteaux akin to a grand castle or simply a turret clad stately family home.<br>
		 These are places where kings and lords once resided and ran the villages and towns you lightly pedal through, or where artists, like Leonardo Da Vinci, came to showcase their work as special guests of the Monarchs.
		 </p>
		 <p> Then we have my country of birth, the scenic Romania. With its lush landscapes and picturesque villages, it truly is a place of beauty.<br>Romanian castles can be found in abundance, but Bran Castle in Transylvania is one of Romania’s best-known landmarks – a 14th-century fortress sitting atop a hillside in the Carpathian Mountains.<br>
		 The monument became home to the world’s most notorious vampire, Count Dracula, made famous by Bram Stoker’s 1987 novel about the curse of the undead.
		 Count Dracula is based on Vlad “The Impaler” Tepes, who was allegedly imprisoned here for a few months.

		 <h1> Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) </h1>
<p> the IaaS model caters to  a businesses' needs for scalability, flexibility and reliability via the cloud, as well as negating the need to maintain hardware in the office space.
This is a completely outsourced service that operates on a pay-to-use model and is available for public,private and also hybrid infrastructure formats.
using the IaaS structure brings a certain degree of complexity however we here at Churchill Schwartz know that it allows our clients to have unparalleled flexibilty.
This structure is best suited for small and medium enterprises and is a great option for a organisations that need cost effective yet scalable IT solutions capable of supporting business growth.
</P>

<h1> Software as a Service (SaaS) </h1>
<p> Using this service model, our clients have the use of leveraging the cloud for software architecture, thus cutting back signifcantly on the burdens of operations, maintenance and support systems.
This service is made possible using a vendor computer which runs applications on that system rather than the user's computer. The SaaS is run and managed from our centralized location which means 
the organisations that use our services are not concerned about maintenance. This service is especially valuable for CRM or applications recquiring extensive web access. SaaS is an excellent cloud computing service for short term projects.
</p>

<h1>Platform as a Service (PaaS) </h1>
<p>this model deploys software and infrastructure framework offered by us for businesses to develop and run applications of their own as well. PaaS clouds are developed alongside and within IaaS clouds 
with a view on scaling the process of application deployment , making the user's expenses highly predictable. With PaaS, web applications can be developed with ease and in a time efficient manner, the cloud 
service also carries the requisite robustness and flexibility to support the process and to run the application as smoothly as possible. it is ideal for business setups that revolve around either leveraging existing data
sources or involving projects that require inputs from multiple developers.
